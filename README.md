The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. I have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

I have been given access to earthquake data that recorded a magnitude of 2.5+ data over the last month. With this data, I will be creating a map that marks the earthquake location and provides information regarding it depth and magnitude such as in the image below.

## Introduction
This application will have 2 javascripts that can be ran to generate mapping visualization. By default, logic.js from the folder leaflet-part-1 will be ran and generate its visualizations.

It will provide a basic topographic map that marks the earthquake locations.
